1. Hadoop: contains the complete source code for the project, the JAR file, and the .txt files for the sanitized dataset, the intermediate output, and the final output.

2. Sanitize_Dataset: the Java project for sanitizing the dataset (removing empty rows).

3. Spark: contains the folder with the source code, the JAR file, the .txt files containing the original dataset, the sanitized dataset, and the final output, the folder containing the output files generated by Spark, and the launch_single.sh file to run the program.
